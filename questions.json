    },
    {
        "question": "What's behind that door?",
        "answer": "Another room? Another memory? Or perhaps just... more darkness."
    },
    {
        "question": "Am I going mad?",
        "answer": "Sanity is just a perspective. It can shift."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does the eye watch?",
        "answer": "It looks for something. Or perhaps it just likes to see."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will I ever leave?",
        "answer": "That depends entirely on you... and the house."
